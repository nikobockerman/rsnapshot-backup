rsnapshot-backup
================

Wrapper for rsnapshot. Emails rsnapshot output when rsnapshot is not executed successfully. Allows mounting external filesystem before executing rsnapshot and unmounting afterwards.

Settings:

- email-settings.cfg
This file contains settings for sending email. Check the default file for required variables.

- folders under /etc/rsnapshot-backup
Every folder represents a backup job. The name of the folder is the name of the backup job.
Every backup job folder contains two files:
  - settings.cfg
  This file currently only contains one optional settings: mount point for mounting and unmounting before and after running rsnapshot
  - rsnapshot.conf
  This file is a complete config file which is passed to rsnapshot as config file parameter.


Calling rsnapshot-backup:
rsnapshot-backup <backup job name> <retain>

That call will result to this rsnapshot call:
rsnapshot -c /etc/rsnapshot-backup/<backup job name>/rsnapshot.conf <retain>
